# The Supersonic Plugin For Scroll Based Animation

Once upon a time, I suddenly realized that I need to animate 1000 pictures of my cat Bartholomew with scrolling. Moreover, it had to work on mobiles as is, without any additional rules. And work fast without killing the browser. And be highly customizable to fit any needs.

Other solutions did not go well, so I decided to write my own (of course, I did).

[Go check the final result and see how 1000 Bartholomews are animated!](https://the-illarionov.github.io/the-supersonic-plugin-for-scroll-based-animation/bartholomew.html)
